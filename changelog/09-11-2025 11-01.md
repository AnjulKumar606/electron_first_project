## Documentation Update and Preload Fix

### Summary
This update primarily focuses on documentation clarity by introducing a detailed Mermaid flowchart that visualizes the complete automated workflow for changelog generation, covering steps from webhook trigger through AI processing and final commit. Additionally, a minor cosmetic typo was corrected in a console logging statement within the `preload.js` file.

### Changed Files Details
*   **`mermaid.md`** (Added, +55): A new file containing a comprehensive Mermaid flowchart diagram. This diagram maps out the entire process, including webhook handling, metadata extraction, commit aggregation loops, AI prompt building, and the final GitHub API calls for updating the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
*   **`preload.js`** (Modified, +1/-1): Corrected a minor typo in a console log message, changing the output from `loadeded` to `loaded`.

### Impact
The impact is low. The addition of the workflow diagram significantly improves internal documentation and understanding of the system architecture. The code change is purely cosmetic, fixing a logging typo, and introduces no functional changes or regressions to the application logic. Commit messages were (unknown).

### Testing
Visual verification confirmed the accuracy and structure of the new Mermaid flowchart. The typo fix in `preload.js` was verified by inspecting the console output during application startup. All testing was (inferred).
