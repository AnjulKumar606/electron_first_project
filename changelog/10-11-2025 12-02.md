## Documentation Update and Typo Fix

### Summary
This update introduces comprehensive internal documentation detailing the automated changelog generation workflow using a Mermaid flowchart. A minor typographical error was also corrected in the application's preload script.

### Changes
*   **Documentation Added:** A new file, `mermaid.md`, was created containing a detailed Mermaid flowchart. This chart maps the entire automated process, including webhook triggers, commit aggregation, AI generation, and final file commitment.
*   **Typo Fixed:** Corrected a console log message in `preload.js`, changing the string from `loadeded` to `loaded`.
*   **Testing Commit:** A dedicated commit was logged for testing purposes (e56eaed).

### Impact
The primary impact is improved clarity for maintainers and developers regarding the complex, multi-stage process used for automated changelog creation (inferred). The typo correction in `preload.js` has no functional impact on end-users.

### Testing
Basic functional testing was performed following the documentation and minor code changes. The new flowchart was visually reviewed for accuracy against the existing workflow implementation.
