## Workflow Diagram Added and Typo Fixed

### Summary
This pull request primarily focuses on documentation enhancement by adding a comprehensive Mermaid flowchart that visualizes the automated changelog generation workflow, detailing steps from webhook triggering through AI processing and final file commitment. Additionally, a minor cosmetic typo was corrected within the `preload.js` file.

### Changed Files Details
*   **mermaid.md** (Added): A new file containing a detailed Mermaid flowchart. This diagram outlines the entire automated process, including webhook handling, metadata extraction, commit collection loops, aggregation, AI generation, and final file creation/update.
*   **preload.js** (Modified): Corrected a minor typo in a console log message, changing `loadeded` to `loaded`.

### Impact
The impact is low. The addition of the `mermaid.md` diagram significantly improves the clarity and documentation of the system's architecture and operational flow for developers and maintainers. The change in `preload.js` is purely cosmetic and has no functional impact on the application runtime.

### Testing
Visual verification of the new Mermaid diagram was performed to ensure the workflow logic is accurately represented. The typo fix in `preload.js` was confirmed to resolve the incorrect console output (inferred). No functional regression testing was required due to the nature of the changes.
