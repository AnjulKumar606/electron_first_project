## Documentation Update and Typo Fix

### Summary
This change primarily focuses on improving internal documentation by adding a detailed Mermaid flowchart illustrating the automated changelog generation workflow. Additionally, a minor typo was corrected in a console logging statement within the Electron preload script.

### Changed Files Details
*   **mermaid.md** (Added, +55): A new file containing a comprehensive Mermaid flowchart. This diagram maps the entire process flow, starting from a Webhook Trigger, through collecting PR commits, processing data in a per-commit loop, aggregating results, generating content via AI, and finally committing the updated changelog file.
*   **preload.js** (Modified, +1/-1): Corrected a minor typographical error in an internal console log message (changed `loadeded` to `loaded`).

### Impact
The functional impact is minimal. The correction in `preload.js` only affects internal debugging logs and has no user-facing consequences. The addition of `mermaid.md` significantly enhances the clarity of the (inferred) automated pipeline documentation for developers and maintainers.

### Testing
The typo fix was verified via visual inspection. The Mermaid diagram was tested to ensure correct rendering and accurate representation of the documented workflow steps (inferred). Commit messages were (unknown).
